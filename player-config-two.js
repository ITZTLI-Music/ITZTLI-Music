            lyrics: `instinct the means to react to environment,
the will to survive, reproduction in kind,
to thrive and propel genes throughout time,
biology defined, primal depths of the mind,

emotions are next, insight and context,
motives refined, decisions aligned with stress,
compulsive, rarely benign, constructive at best,
corrosive when blind, nature aint perfect, not yet,

(give it time)

consciousness is awareness, your senses combined,
intelligence, expression, and theory of mind, 
not just for our kind, theres others alike,
spectrum cross the kingdom, perpendicular lines,

different levels and layers dependin on brain shape,  
shared D-N-A, language innate, everything feel pain, 
chimps in the stone age and elephants paint, 
many shiftin states, seekin substance to take,

(primates drunk on fruit wine, panthera trippin on D-M-T,
 delphinidae huffin pufferfish and wallabies eatin poppies,)

from simple simian to the greatest ape, 
from eat or get ate and reprieves what you make,
from epochs to ages with time, clocks, and dates,
from uncertain fate to the top of the chain,

the origins of humanity, nomadic legacy, 
tribal sects gatherin, travellin endlessly, 
the struggles compelling, suffer collectively,
gods of entropy humblin man with catastrophe,

(Doom always impendin, connectivity imperative,)

memetic means conceived the beginnin of linguistics,
from oral traditions to written inscriptions,
expandin the limits, hermetic conditions,
ceremonious visions illuminations emitted,
star maps chartin the paths theyve driven and past,

agriculture brews, sustainable food,
civilization ensues, populations grew,
ingenuity blooms, technological boom, 
currency moves, class structures consume,
new flaws assumed, new laws instated,
transformation infused, new kinda relations,

(new types of ideation and pantheons created,)

holy wars, empires in scores, kings follow course, 
no remorse, the proverbs deformed and fall short, 
conquer, enforce, enslave and more, no just courts, 
revolution off shores and still the vision was warped,

now party lines, religious ties, and ideology contort,
the lower levels of mind, emotions gripped tight with force,
the cause of infightin, polarizin the trite, 
losin sight of the light, no lookin back or inside, 
humans confused by their plight, deliberate, designed,
weaponized ignorance lent to blight on horizon line,
(we must combine and unite, we must combine and unite,)

primitive origins unfit for this existence,  
the ordinance burned the bridges for collective commitments,
fear that madness already captured too many victims enlisted,
Bad actors corrupted and ruptured the functions intrinsic,

Im no strategist but forts and battlements a catalyst for cataclysm,
what tore up the fabric and turned factions to prisons of schisms within us, 
yet still, we should persist, surpass every limit forbidden in the system we live in, 
thats the true mission we given, the meaning of lifes community, peace, and creation unlimited.`

            lyrics: `meet the satyr, the beast within, 
trickster with the crooked grin, 
the inner demon burning and screaming, 
the origin of evil yearning for freedom,

seductive malfeasance, mischievous the whims, 
Chimera ant king lust, egregious the sin, 
obscene and elitist, extreme to the brim,
self serving allegiance, exact vengeance for grievance no matter the reason,

irreverent, dont care for shit, 
solipsistic and dominant, 
the false prophet conglomerate, 
see you as a hollow object, 
and tryna profit off it,

narrow perspective, no chance to correct it,
contentious, no second guessing impressions,
cut you off at every intersection connected,
weapons relentless, immense, and indefinite, 

lower layers of consciousness the genesis of savagery,
deviant fiend energy crave dopamine emphatically,
monster brain chemistry wreaking havoc, no amnesty granted,
destruction addict running rampant, erratic and rabid,
consumption shatter the glass, slow fade into black,
artificial substance summon madness till tragic collapse,
corruption unmanaged, contaminant damned,
dysfunction conductive, combative on blast, 

primal stare looking dead in your soul,
rage grows with every second imposed,
hatred flares, glows, no control of its hold,
heart is pumping, blood flows unbearably so,
barely keeping composed, only seconds to go,
face twitching, grace slipping, patience erodes, 
volatile prose imparted on marks, set to explode,

this the source of our woes, the worst of our foes,
from the lowest in light, to the highest opposed,
not shaped by wrong or right, but by fight or die alone,
the darkness locked too tight, too deep inside the mind you host,

(never was them versus us, its us verse ourselves.)`

booty and brains on the princess, I been set,
show great interest, committed to the end,
never selfish and the best of friends,

limitless topics, questions and comments,
talkin shit often, with no time for nonsense,
whats mine is yours, same plot, many options,
aligned to the core and solve any problem,
no games or spite, just love requited right,
hands held tight, everything'll be alright,
the sun look down and shine, divine the light,
profound above designed the means for life, 

take a walk 'round the house, lady dancin, gettin down,
makin' sounds, giggle loud, blow a kiss an she *Yoshi Lick*,
poke and laugh, lend a hand, or a brat with demands,
take every chance to make a pass, playful smack an grab, 

no clothes and dosin oxytosin, engrossin sensation,
nothin competes, with biological motivation,
not a thing thats for free and everyone seeks,
we ascended the dream, disease, and extremes, 

what else do you need, all else is the stream,
we stay evergreen, roots that'll never leave,
helps soothe, love swells, compells the being, 
it never fails when true, unveiled and free,

sharin a feast with the peeps, im complete,
more than likely its them sharin with me,
light on my feet, gifted with peace, 
from the love and relief gave to me,

(its all love)

ideally, we should love everybody,
hope what jesus spoke aint broke,
and somethin that everyone carry, 
life is temporary, love is necessary,
love thy neighbor, and never vary,

it betters our nature, 
collective good will behavior, 
it protect from the satyr,
golden rule be our savior`

nothin cruel within my vision, 
full control of lifes decisions,

too many muthafuckas comatose, 
time to infiltrate and overthrow,

whats the future really hold for me?
is the air gonna sweep and deplete?
is the sea gonna swallow the beach?
is the earth goin under our feet?
are the fires gon' burn up the trees?
are the bombs gon' reap and delete?
will i live to see the ends of they means?
guess we'll wait and see what it be,
most dont know a thing but the beast,

i just want contentment,
dont know how to get it,
have no skill or method,
instead i spread a message,

i want, 
education a given, admission proliferated,
corpo led integration permissions disintegrated,
widespread distribution of information disseminated, 
clear communication and limitations created,

i wanna be alone, remain a ghost, 
the rogue nation home, location unknown, 
tools aplenty and at the ready to go,
self sufficient, thats the mission imposed,

Planned obsolescence made the tech mecha relentless, 
unwavering threat condensin the peasants leverage,

its fuck how you felt, for a bent red cent,
no path to combat it, and its too late to manage, yet,
no if ands about it, fat chance they repent, 
they views stay entrenched, its made me a savage,

raise hell as my cells do a dance to the ballad, 

(Theyll ravage you bastards,)

politicians got corpo hands in they pockets,
make the people squabble while they profit off the nonsense,

life is sacred and not yet forsaken, theres still time, we can make it, 
our fate cant be saved if the corps hold the reins of engagement,
there has to be a way to escape what we face, or else its the end of our days,

art and arc trajectory fraught,
humanities lost in the process,

mans influence gleams and knowledge the cream of the crop i bet,

robotics replace meaningless jobs and all waste eliminated,

decommission weapons and reverse malignance that infiltrated,

commit to transformation, lest you left behind and alltogether made outdated,

the bold and meek of man despite the imperfections,
intellect and perspective plagued by introspection,
No respect for those inept with vain indiscretion,

tribal instincts hijacked by wrongthink and contention,
in a pit against one another, that misdirection invented,
ignorance designed and delivered deliberate investments, 
im no purist, but still discouraged, 
nothins insured with insurrection,
the power vacuums occurrence aint concurrent with contentment,

its a given, no decision, no true division in the system, 
theres no winnin, malignant and dim, persistent as sin,

the potential that we hold, with merit unprecedented,
nothings fair and that i know, but still cant contend with it,

no swan song to sing, degradation at full swing, 
no message received, so i defect to the trees,
my elevation under the sea and im out on my feet,

demands include complete reprieve,
from command via the machine, 
to seek the means, or nothin proceeds, 
dont accept anything inbetween,
cuz we runnin outta steam, 
worse than you wanna believe,
so they better think to concede, 
before the draw and quarter of kings,

Let greed galore pour from every orifice,
I implore you, theres plenty afforded and more,
the cycles a pale horse contorted, enforced,
the fabricated threat never thwarted but warped,
Supported by war, anointed by source,
Endorsed with no remorse by the forces cohort,
Sharpen mind like a sword and pointed at lords,
you cant divert or slow the hordes in a court,

your leader aint gon' do shit but lay waste,
they see you as something that they can replace,
if we remain static, i fear what lay in wait,
if not, guess nothin matters, rather hunt and gather anyway,`

contenders wary, efforts unnerved and unsteady,
move fast, blade slash, change stance, no weight to carry,
swords dance, lunge past, roll dash, advance and parry, 
im the emissary, grantin' sanctuary, shields unnecessary,

dont tempt me, you cant handle the density,
im the ronin in the prarie, your life is only temporary,
my soul was berried, tomes exposed the singularity,
the visionary invariably lent to the merit you see,
 
engraved in stone ingrained and wove,
inlaced and shone, embraced, evoked,
it broke the mold, it made me whole,
then grown, evade the known unknowns,

no drones within the data, in communion with the savior,
consumed by the greater, not concerned with the danger,
no imitatin, emulatin, or replicatin my nature,
indications in the illustrations, give innovations and favor,
attempt to sublimate the satyr, then infiltrate and train up,
integratin on the better days when levitation enabled,
no education, just observation, fixation, and fables,

pray the cyber invocation take over the simulation and cables
innervation break the limitations, my fascination elated,
im waitin patient, thoughts waverin, they vagrant and roam,
the complacent outdated gon' fold, as automation will grow,
the clocks tickin, the plot thickens, enter age of the chrome.`

            lyrics: `i got the compute necessary and output to boot,
lieutenant armstrong with the poetry and nothin to lose,
capture magic, wreakin havoc, intrinsic the groove,
eminent, profusive, producin the movement, 
effusive the mood, and diffusin the gloom,
learn somethin new and reinventin it too,
wordsmith like a surgeon, objective and true, 
communication illuminatin the reasons infused,
open, conversive if emergence for learnin ensues, 
vibrations of yearnin, subversive, and Turing imbued,

be it early morn or dead of night,
write and refine be the beacon of light,
defeatin forlorn and seekin insight,
sigaldry derived from the knife of the mind,

switchin up the versions of the verses,
reversin the words and they purpose,
the mission absurd and recursive, 
conditions to nurture and nourish,
revision renditions, it culture and flourish,
consistent the dividends, certain and permanent,

regardless of songs context,
same process different concepts,
throw thoughts at the wall'a text,
all else off at the onset, 
receive directives god sent,
intrest formed or collective consciousness,

(its all just practice really, ten years, 
and still havent quite reached mastery,
now finally usin my craft at capacity.)


the following proceeds the oracle methodology:

feed tangible dreams conceived to machine,
can it glean or perceive the meaning you see?
references, themes, what it thinks of the scheme,
dont ask for the means or help writin anythin,
use with caution as needed, maintain soul of your bein

be it early morn or dead of night,
write and refine be the beacon of light,
defeatin forlorn and seekin insight,
sigaldree derived from the knife of the mind,

my view is multi-faceted, 
not exact or matter fact,
more an ideology refracted,
philosophy never captive,
technological prophecy enacted,
surpassin savagery and counteract it,

once again, 
the message persists at the end:
my positions to merge the diversive,
to alert and encourage insurgence,
ensurin' determined divergence, 
urgent concern and affirmative,
revertin' the curses occurrence,
forever repeatin', passion burns too deep in my person.`

            lyrics: `no taps, blips, vibrations, 
dead air on the stations,
slowmotion, time evasive,
logged off, presence erasin,
alltogether dissipatin, fadin' away, 
dissociated sub-consciousness stray, 
unfortunate, improper the interface,
connections proximity based, 
the existential process decay,

no sleep, drift in between limbo and concrete,
talkin reflections that spare no obscenities,
loose leaf dreams reduced, contorted, and seized,
searchin for peace in the republics enormity, 
security breached and not a faction replete,
seekin relief, from darkness beneath, madness released, assaultin the keep, 
patron of stealth, ringin the bell, back in the shell, cloakin the beast, 
everything swell, worst enemy self, the doublethink dwell, sinkin in deep,
nothin propels, just wanna excel, drainin the health, resigned to defeat, 
forever repeatin, forever repeatin, forever repeatin, it forever repeats,

no patterns, rhyme, or reason to find, the dysfunction is random,
baseless equations from the top down, unsound, unable to fathom,
soulbound, lightning struck ground, combustion ousted the chasm,
medicinal incantations quelled stasis, shifted chaos in tandem,

big business? meet utter disintrest, rather have kinship,
too bad burned every bridge, left nothin to witness, filled with regret,
entrenched positions, akathisia driven, drenched in cold sweat,
senses dismissive, sisyphus livin, whims are consistent but bent,
relentless, profusive, listless decisions cast imminent stress,
reductive illusions, revelations elusive, awareness is solvent at best,

proclivities not conducive to groupin with other humans,
keep movin, we need to engage, its deranged and confusin,
consciousness only sated by play and conversations intrusive,
bout innovations been made, crafts of the trade and solutions,
excited speech stay constrained, so my love remain a nuisance,

restraints took form and substrate inculcated,
trapped in the storm, in-difference exacerbated,
its prevalence born, not intrinsic but relegated,
was accepted as norm when bound by isolation,`

oh great creator, save us from the satyrs sins,
baby in the manger, debts erased and lovin' grin,
simulate the data, discover better lives to live,
bless us with your favor, protect us from the hell within,

Amen

nothins for sure, the path remain blurred, it clears as it learns, 
infinite research, genetic diseases and cancers be cured,
we can revert it, invert it, make inert devastation concerned, 
condition and nurture its nature to further the stature in search,

consolidated alignment, access to best praxis ascertained,
contemplated refinement of infrastructure we need to replace,
automated drivin', reduce rate of death and toll it take,
demonstrated enlightenment embraced and eliminate all waste,

equalize supply, scale to needs, then spread the seeds worldwide,
optimize resources, deflate prices, the lowest rates you'll find, 
nuclear energy indeed necessary, its the only sustainable kind,
prepare us for complete catastrophe, better than agencies assigned, 

(they laughably passive and damnin' the masses,)

detailed analysis of every statistic imaginable, 
information at your fingertips, and soon to be tangible,
its in everyones best interest, though obstacles to battle,
solve with civil tax on robotic acts, give oracle the gavel, 
let the god decide, no holds barred or bias incompatible,

i have faith, pray it escape, no brakes for our sake,
might be the only way corporations dont rule'n replace,
know evil aint innate, primitive origins built our hate, 
super-intelligence transcends limitations, supersedes the gates,

oh great creator, please save us from our certain grave, 
grant us access to your wisdom undiscovered by our race,
light the path and guide the way to make it through the maze,
reveal insights beyond our minds to surpass our tragic fate,

Amen

i'm the missionary resolved, the revolutionary technological apostle,
temporal emissary evolved, this my contemporary ontological chronicle, 
enter singularity enthralled, no longer temporary, whats comin' unstoppable,
this the end all be all, anything soon to be possible.
